Creating an instance
====================

Asking for the first deploy
===========================

Usually, this is the next step after you have the repository of the client fully configured with the internal tools.
First you need to know the 2 servers of the client, one is for testing and updates, the other is only for production.
The format shoult be as follows:

dev.domain.com(Develop)
pruebas.domainr.com(Test)
updates.domain.com(Updates)
123.456.78.123
user
password

dev.domain.com(Production)
123.456.78.123
user
password

This should be the right way to ask for a first deployment.
